Hi!
This is my first project so it is flawed a lot.
It is more like an experiment,
so I don't recommend you to build it.
But if you really want to - have fun while doing so!
The instructions are in the PDF file.
The code is in INO file.
The 3D files are STL.
And if you want to customize your system, use the BLEND file.

And if you like it - please don't eat ducks.

Thank you - JTF labs (MakerDuck3)
